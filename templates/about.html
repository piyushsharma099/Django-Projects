                <h3>What is PROJECTSOPEDIA ? </h3>
                PROJECTSOPEDIA is basically a website which manages the project of past year college students and gives projects suggestion to juniors who wants to make project.
                Traditionally, projects of students are managed in excel sheets but in excel sheets we canâ€™t perform intelligent operations, hard to share with everyone and many more, so to tackle with these problems we come with an idea of PROJECTSOPEDIA to create a Web-Page and to perform ML algorithm (Text-mining) on the webpage to make it more intelligent.
